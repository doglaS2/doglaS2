## Hi, i'm DougðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm a Software Engineering undergraduate at **UNIPAMPA** and IT Technician from **IFFar**.  
My main focus is on **Data Engineering**, working with tools and technologies such as:

- **Apache Kafka**
- **Apache Airflow**
- **Apache Spark**
- **Python**
- **MongoDB**
- **Django**
- **SQL**
- **Docker**

I enjoy building data pipelines that are scalable, reliable, and easy to maintain â€” combining batch and real-time processing to enable better decisions through data.

Although my primary interest is in data, I also have experience in software development using:

- **PHP**
- **Java**
- **JavaScript**
- **React**
- **Vue**
- **TailwindCSS**

This background helps me bridge the gap between data platforms and product engineering when needed.
