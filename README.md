# Hi, I'm Doug 👋

I'm a Software Engineering undergraduate at **UNIPAMPA** and an IT Technician from **IFar**.

## 📊 Data Engineering Focus

My main focus is on **Data Engineering**, working with tools and technologies such as:

* **Apache Kafka**
* **Apache Airflow**
* **Apache Spark**
* **Python**
* **MongoDB**
* **Django**
* **SQL**
* **Docker**

I enjoy building **data pipelines** that are **scalable**, **reliable**, and **easy to maintain** — combining **batch** and **real-time** processing to enable better decisions through data.

## 💻 Software Development Experience

Although my primary interest is in data, I also have experience in software development using:

* **PHP**
* **Java**
* **JavaScript**
* **React**
* **Vue**
* **TailwindCSS**

This background helps me bridge the gap between data platforms and product engineering when needed.
